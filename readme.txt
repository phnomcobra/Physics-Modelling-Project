Amateur Techniques of Particle Based Physics Modeling

Justin Dierking

I’m presenting a project that provides a new process in which geometrical primitives (triangular surfaces, linear segments) interact with lagrangian particle fields using projected shadowing particles. I’ve achieved realistic small scale behavior of interacting dynamic objects and particle fields. Simulations are constructed and visualized using a very simple simplex format and manipulation toolkit based out of the Matlab programming language. Subsequently, this toolkit interfaces to the fisx.exe engine which achieves a simulation’s enumerative computation.
